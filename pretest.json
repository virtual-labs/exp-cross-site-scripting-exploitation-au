      "question": "What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users",
        "b": "A method for securely transferring data between servers",
        "c": "A protocol used for encrypting user credentials",
        "d": "A tool for testing server response times"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! XSS is a vulnerability where attackers inject scripts into web pages, affecting other users' browsers. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. XSS is a security vulnerability, not a data transfer method.",
        "c": "Incorrect. XSS isn't related to encrypting user credentials.",
        "d": "Incorrect. XSS is not used for testing server response times."

    {
      "question": "How can XSS vulnerabilities be exploited?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By injecting malicious scripts into input fields that are stored and displayed to other users",
        "b": "By increasing server bandwidth",
        "c": "By deleting database records",
        "d": "By disabling browser cookies"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject scripts into input fields, which are then stored and executed when viewed by other users. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bandwidth affects data transfer, not XSS exploitation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Deleting records isn't typically associated with XSS attacks.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Browser cookies are unrelated to XSS exploitation."

    {
      "question": "Why is input validation important in preventing XSS?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It ensures that user input meets specified criteria and does not contain malicious scripts",
        "b": "It optimizes server response times",
        "c": "It encrypts data during transmission",
        "d": "It deletes outdated database records"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Proper input validation helps prevent users from injecting malicious scripts that can exploit XSS vulnerabilities. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Input validation is about security, not server response times.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Data encryption during transmission is a separate security measure.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Deleting records isn't related to input validation for XSS prevention."
