      "question": "What is the primary risk associated with stored XSS vulnerabilities?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Execution of malicious scripts on other users' browsers",
        "b": "Slowing down website performance",
        "c": "Changing the website's visual layout",
        "d": "Redirecting users to external websites"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stored XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website's database, which are then executed when other users view the affected pages, compromising their browsers. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Stored XSS primarily affects user security rather than website performance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Stored XSS focuses on injecting scripts, not changing visual layout.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While possible, the primary risk of stored XSS is script execution, not redirection."

      "question": "How can stored XSS vulnerabilities be mitigated?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Input validation and output encoding",
        "b": "Increasing server bandwidth",
        "c": "Using larger database storage",
        "d": "Disabling JavaScript on the server"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Proper input validation and output encoding techniques help prevent malicious scripts from being stored and executed. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bandwidth affects data transfer, not vulnerability mitigation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Storage size is unrelated to XSS vulnerability mitigation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Disabling JavaScript server-side does not mitigate stored XSS on client browsers."

    {
      "question": "What does a successful stored XSS attack allow an attacker to do?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Execute arbitrary scripts on other users' browsers",
        "b": "Download files from the server",
        "c": "Change server-side application logic",
        "d": "Increase server response time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A successful stored XSS attack lets an attacker execute scripts on other users' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf. <a href='https://www.example.com'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. Stored XSS primarily involves script execution rather than file downloads.",
        "c": "Incorrect. XSS attacks target client-side, not server-side logic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Server response time isn't directly impacted by stored XSS attacks."
